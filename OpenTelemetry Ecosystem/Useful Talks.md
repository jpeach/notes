# Useful Talks
## Pintrace: A Distributed Tracing Pipeline
https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/karumuri

> In this talk, I will present PinTrace, our zipkin based distributed tracing infrastructure. I will also talk about the challenges of instrumenting and deploying the tracing in a polyglot micro-services architecture at scale.

## Tracing Bare Metal with OpenTelemetry
https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas/presentation/tobey

> Principal Engineer Amy Tobey and SRE Shelby Spees share how the Equinix Metal Engineering team deployed OpenTelemetry tracing for the bare metal provisioning process.

> Haozhe Gao and Joe O’Neill present Canopy, Facebook’s performance and efficiency tracing infrastructure.

## Murron: Reliable Logging Pipeline at Slack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkmqpNbCJYk
> This talk walks through the first-generation logging infrastructure and some of the problems we have encountered. We will then cover the second-generation logging infrastructure design, how we added reliability as a built-in feature of the systems, the overall design principles, and some of the best practices for designing scalable logging infrastructure.

## Metrics, Logs & Traces; What Does the Future Hold for Observability?

> The “the three pillars” of observability - monitoring, logging and tracing - were so 2018. A growing consensus is questioning the efficacy of this approach. So what’s the next step? Without dwelling on past, Frederic and Tom will present three exciting trends in observability for 2019 and beyond. Future developments need to tame complexity, enhance understanding and accelerate incident response.
