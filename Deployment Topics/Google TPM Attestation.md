Github project is [go-attestation](https://github.com/google/go-attestation).

The free book
[A Practical Guide to TPM 2.0](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4302-6584-9.pdf)
is pretty interesting. Not sure that it's written for a TPM novice
(e.g. I don't much care about changes from TPM 1.2), but with some
careful reading there's a lot of good topics.
